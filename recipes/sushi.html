        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This sushi recipe is a homemade version of
            a famously difficult dish to make. It will 
            not be as luxurious as sushi made by a sushi chef,
            but it IS much cheaper.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the ingredients we will use in the recipe
            is raw fish, so handle this sensative ingredient
            with care.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salmon</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Nori</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 1/2c white rice (dry) into strainer</li>
            <li>Run water over rice in strainer until the water is no longer cloudy</li>
            <li>Place rice in rice cooker with 1c cold water</li>
            <li>Turn on rice cooker</li>
            <li>While rice is cooking, lay out the nori with the shy side towards the cutting surface (this will be the side we see once we roll it)</li>
            <li>Take your salmon and cut into thin, long strips (about the length of your longest finger)</li>
            <li>Wash your hands after handling raw fish</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the rice on top of the nori, pressing gently without smashing</li>
            <li>Lay a row of each salmon, cream cheese, and avocado on top of the rice (enough to cover the shortest distance between two edges of nori)</li>
            <li>Roll up the sushi tightly using a bamboo mat</li>
            <li>Cut the pieces and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
